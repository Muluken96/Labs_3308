final project:  
Avoke is our website that we built for our semester project. It was created to give people a way to visualize the music they listen to. Our Avoke website will first have you create an account needing an email and a password. The user after signing up will be given the option to sign in. The user will then be directed to our home page and be able to visualize. Once and audio file is uploaded the visulaizer will play an animation. The user will additionally have access to the Avoke about us and to login again.
